				hi,, this is me, Nipi,,i'm studying CSE at Northern University . Basically maximum students have fixed already  aim in their life,,, but i dunno what will i do! i don't like programming. from few days i start to like website designing! though i dunno much about website designing,, but  i m trying to learn it,, feeling like,,yes this is what, i can make my goal! i wanna be a web developer. so for this i m trying to find out the easiest way to learn very well . besides this i love to sing,dance, imagine my own world! i like to observe people! i like to think about life and analyse what i learn from life... i love to watch horror , advanture and mystery types of movies! 
did u think anytime,, we people are many time so misterious and we don't wanna share this mystery with anyone! do you learn from your mistakes? do u ask for forgiven, if u make something wrong with anyone? i think i'm telling much! talk later,, tata !
